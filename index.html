            <p> I am a young father with a second child on the way. I am intested in skateboarding, computers, and art. I really enjoy my son's smile, i think that is the most valuble thing to me. It feels as though he is a gift to me, and I am lucky enough to be his dad. I am excited and nervous to bring another new life into this world, a baby girl. Family though is what keeps me grounded, they help me to feel needed. I am lucky to be their protector. Skateboarding is a creative output that I get to act silly, exercise and overcome opposition through trial and error. I have skateboarded my whole life. I enjoy the challenge. I am finding the same challenges though in coding computers. Computers mimick the feelings of failure and success!</p>
