            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Being in the Jackson Hole area, there is a lot of beautiful landscape to be experienced. 
                We are one of many Whitewater Rafting companies in the area. Our main goal is that we want 
                people that are from out of town to become familiar with us, and understand that their 
                experience with us will be the best.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                Our audience would be out of town people young people mostly looking for a thrill, 
                and they will likely be young professionals. Accesing the website will provide a means
                to become familiar how to book and participate in our adventures. Their needs arent being 
                met by our competetors and ourself at this time. They are having a hard time finding the 
                information for meeting places and cost. This information through our site is typically accesed
                before their trip on their laptop, otherwise in town on their mobile phone.
